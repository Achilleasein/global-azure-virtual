## Gettin Started
To begin executing ```cd``` into the main folder and use the following command ```docker-compose up --build``` </br>
You may need to use sudo depending on your os and the privileges. </br>
We are going to use docker containers, which saves us the hassle of installing multiple things, we just let the docker handle all our installation needs.
